# Hosting Wyzie Subs

Anyone can host Wyzie Subs, but it costs a lot of money. Wyzie relies on a swarm of proxies to do its bidding (around 200+). These proxies can be hosted basically anywhere: Cloudflare Workers, Netlify, Railway, Vercel, Azureâ€”the list goes on. They are extremely fast and lightweight and can be used to proxy requests. We then cache all of the data we serve, so we only make a limited number of requests to Open-Subtitles. Additionally, the public Wyzie Subs code is not up-to-date with the currently deployed version, meaning some secret sauce is missing.

<Warning>
Without a sufficient number of proxies, the API will not work and will continuously return 500 errors because it is getting blocked.
