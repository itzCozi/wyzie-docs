# Hosting Wyzie Subs

Anyone can host Wyzie Subs, but it does involve costs. Wyzie relies on a single i6.shark proxy that generates IPv6 addresses on a VPS with a /48 subnet. Setting up i6.shark is challenging as there is no official documentation (too lazy), but once configured, you simply need to update the proxy URL in "proxy.ts" to point to your VPS's IP address.

## Steps
<Steps>
  <Steps.Step>
    Host your instance of (i6.shark)[https://github.com/i6.shark] on your VPS.
  </Steps.Step>
  <Steps.Step>
    Change the proxy URL in "proxy.ts" to your VPS's URL and test.
  </Steps.Step>
    <Steps.Step>
    Build Wyzie Subs and host it basically anywhere (I prefer Cloudflare Workers).
  </Steps.Step>
    <Steps.Step>
    Ensure that a transform rule is configured to set `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to `*`.
