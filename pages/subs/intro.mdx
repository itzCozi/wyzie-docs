# Intro to Wyzie Subs

Wyzie Subs is a free and libre open-subtitles scraping API. The user requests the API, and it returns a list of subtitles that fit the arguments given. There are two ways to make requests to the API: using our NPM package or directly fetching the Wyzie API itself. I recommend using our package, but some may find the types cumbersome. In order to use the API, you must first make that decision.

- [NPM Package](usage/package)

- [Direct Fetching](usage/direct)
