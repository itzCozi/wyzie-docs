# Intro to Wyzie Subs

Wyzie Subs is a free and libre open-subtitles scraping API. There are two ways to make requests to the API: using our NPM package or directly fetching the Wyzie API itself. I recommend using our package, but some may find the types cumbersome. In order to use the API, you must first make that decision.

<Note>
  We strongly recommend the NPM package if you are familiar with TypeScript or JavaScript
