# Hosting Wyzie Proxy

Building Wyzie Proxy is easier than breathing, thanks to Nitro. First, clone the repository of Wyzie Proxy using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itzcozi/wyzie-proxy
```

Then, install all the necessary packages with:

```bash
pnpm install
```

After all packages are installed, you can build the proxy:

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeGroup.Code title="Regular">
    ```bash
    pnpm build
    ```
  </CodeGroup.Code>
  <CodeGroup.Code title="Cloudflare Workers">
    ```bash
    pnpm build:cloudflare
    ```
  </CodeGroup.Code>
</CodeGroup>

The output will be generated in the `/.output/server` folder. If you are deploying to Cloudflare Workers, copy and paste the `index.mjs` file to the worker; otherwise, you can deploy the files as normal.
